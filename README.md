# Arena GT 

This is a fun survival/action game  with Ford GT as the main vehicle for the player.  There are four types of power ups: Health,  Nitro,  Shield and Mine. Have fun destroying cars if you're good at it. Please use the file below to play on a Macbook. This is made for Game design project at NYU.

Also 'Z' key works for nitro.
